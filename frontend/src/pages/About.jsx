     Hi! I'm Nishant Baruwal, a passionate full-stack engineer with experience in building modern web applications. I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) and have integrated Firebase for secure authentication and cloud functionalities.

This project is a demonstration of my skills in creating an authenticated page app that provides seamless user experiences with efficient backend communication. I enjoy working on both the frontend and backend, delivering clean, functional code and scalable solutions.

Feel free to explore the project, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed building it!
